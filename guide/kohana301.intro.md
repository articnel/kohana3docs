# Kohana 301
#### A Beginners Guide to Kohana 3 - v0.0.1

Welcome.  This is a beginners guide to Kohana 3.  Before we begin, I'm going to assume you have a good understanding of [PHP5 and Object Oriented Programming](kohana301.php5oop) principles, [Model-View-Controller](kohana301.mvc) principles.

Next, you should understand [Kohana's Cascading Filesystem](kohana301.cascade).  If you are upgrading from Kohana 2.x you might want to read the summary of [differences](kohana301.differences).

Good, let's [get started](kohana301.gettingstarted).
