# Kohana 301
#### A Beginners Guide to Kohana 3 - v0.0.1

Welcome.  This is a beginners guide to Kohana 3.  Before we begin, I'm going to assume you have a good understanding of [PHP5 and Object Oriented Programming](kohana301.php5oop) principles, [Model-View-Controller](kohana301.mvc) principles, and [Kohana's Cascading Filesystem](kohana301.cascade)

Good, first we will discuss the [differences from Kohana 2](kohana301.differences), then talk about the basics of Kohana 3 like the [bootstrap](kohana301.bootstrap) and [routing](kohana301.routing).
